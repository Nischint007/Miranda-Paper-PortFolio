ðŸ§  About This Project
This project is a demonstration of advanced front-end techniques focused heavily on CSS positioning and scroll-based interactions. From the very beginning, the layout and content arrangement demanded precise control of elements across multiple viewports, making this a perfect example of medium to high-level CSS positioning mastery.

Every section and component has been carefully crafted using modern layout methods such as:

position: absolute and fixed layering for dynamic stacking

Flexbox and Grid for structured, responsive design

Smart use of z-index, overflow, and nested containers for seamless transitions

This is not just a visually appealing layout â€” itâ€™s a technically sound, scroll-synchronized experience.

ðŸŒ€ Locomotive Scroll Integration
The website uses Locomotive Scroll to enhance the storytelling flow with smooth scrolling, inertia, and scroll-triggered animations. Integrating this library added depth and interactivity while requiring deep understanding of DOM structure and CSS transform stacking context.

This project reflects my growing expertise in:

Handling complex layouts with overlapping layers and responsive behaviors

Implementing third-party libraries like Locomotive Scroll for immersive UX

Debugging positioning glitches across different browsers and devices
